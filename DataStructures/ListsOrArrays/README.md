# Python Lists
In Python, a list is an ordered sequence of heterogeneous elements. In other words, a list can hold elements with different data types. For example,

list = ['a', 'apple', 23, 3.14] 

lists can hold integers, strings, characters, functions, and pretty much any other data type including other lists simultaneously
list indices start at 0
